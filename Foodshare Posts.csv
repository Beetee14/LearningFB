Also there's boxes of bread,  rolls and tortillas.  If you guys think this is crazy, I actually left about 36 more boxes because I couldn't fit them. This is all from the Public Market and on Saturdays vendors just throw out what they can't take back- including the bread, perfectly good fruits/veggies, etc.  If you like free food and stopping waste, contact Evan Zachary, Kevin Kane and go to the Market on Saturdays with Flower City Pickers every week!

shared_story,13,5,There is still time to assist with a national research effort on Food Insecurity on college campuses...   The College and University Food Bank Alliance which RIT is a member of is conducting the first comprehensive national survey on food insecurity among college students. Given the rising profile of campus food issues, it‚Äôs time for a serious national analysis of this problem. This survey will help answer the outstanding question of how many students nationwide suffer from food insecurity. This research project is being managed by a coalition of student organizations, including the College and University Food Bank Alliance, the National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness, the Student PIRGs, and the Student Government Resource Center.  How You Can Help  You can join this important effort by taking charge of the survey on your campus. Please complete by 5/15/16!  They would appreciate 100 responses per campus  https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2699355/Food-Insecurity-at-RIT?__output=kiosk
